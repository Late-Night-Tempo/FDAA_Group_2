## To Run This Code
You can use Python. You may choose between the Jupyter Notebook or the raw Python file. Pick whichever one you have/prefer.

## Notes for Programmers
- Remember not to leave any data in the code.
- Use dynamic code when possible.
- Add a data directory after pulling, github doesn't wanna keep it for some reason (although I have placed a gitignore on it)
